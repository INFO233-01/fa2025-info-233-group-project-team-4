INFO-233 Group Project – Phase I – Project Definition
Project Name: Currency Exchange Software
Team Name: Group 4 

1.	Define the problem you are trying to solve. (The problem being solved here is simplifying currency conversion) 

2.	How does your program help to solve the problem? (The program will convert any given currency using real world data to display the current exchange rate of said currency) 

3.	Who will be the users of this program. Detail at least two Use Cases

a.	Use Case 1 - A user planning out their travel to another country, that user would like to know how much of that currency they would need to convert to have a substantial amount for their trip similarly a currency exchange booth could use to it make the currency conversion for travelers more efficient which would minimize calculation mistakes.

b.	Use Case 2 - Someone who needs to find a place and activities to do and the travel would be based on the type of climate in the location.

4.	What technology is available to solve the problem?  Identify the specific APIs and Modules to be used	for the program. - (The API we will be using for this would be a currency exchange API which translates currency that is given to it and will translate it to whatever target currency the user wants.)

6.	Detail the sequence of the program- What is the flow of the program? How does a user use the program.
   (The user would first be asked to input the currency they would like to translate, after that there will be a confirmation promt asking the user if what they entered was correct, then the user will be asked what currency they would like to translate to, after that it will ask the user again if what they entered is correct. Lastly the user will be asked to input a total amount of native currency to give the total amount of translated currency they will be recieveing. After that the API will give us the data necessary from the JSON file and display the native currency selected and the target currency wanted then the the 1:1 value will print and the total amount of translated currency as well. 
 
a.	Break up the work in parts to allow the developers to work on the coding in the next phase. Have at least as many parts as there are team members: Some examples can be: User Input, Communications – APIs, Modules, Function Declaration, Research, Exception Handling
